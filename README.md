Beyblade dodge game, as the name suggests it allows user to dodge the beyblades coming from other side. The game animation starts when you press SPACE key from the keyboard and UP â†‘ key is there to make our beyblade jump.   
This game is a simple javascript application, that make full use of the CSS animations and basic javascript methods. It has a counter that counts your score and resets to zero after each round.   
I learnt the Chrome dinosaur game, before applying the same to it, Hope you like it ðŸ˜‡
